Certainly! Below is a concise description of each lab problem:

### Lab 1:
**Objective:** Analyze the efficiency of different adder topologies in terms of processing delay and power consumption.

**Problem:**
- Given two 4-bit unsigned numbers A and B.
- Implement addition using:
  1. 4 full adders and two 4-bit registers (R0 and R1).
  2. 1 full adder and two 4-bit registers (R0 and R1).
- Compare scenarios in terms of processing delay and power consumption.

### Lab 2:
**Objective:** Analyze the efficiency of different adder/subtractor topologies in terms of processing delay and power consumption.

**Problem:**
- Given two 4-bit unsigned numbers A and B.
- Implement addition using carry generate and propagate logic.
- Implement subtraction using carry generate and propagate logic and ripple carry adder.
- Compare performance with Lab 1 scenarios in terms of processing delay and power consumption.

### Lab 3:
**Objective:** Analyze the efficiency of multiplier topologies in terms of processing delay and power consumption.

**Problem:**
- Given two 4-bit numbers A and B.
- Implement:
  1. Array multiplier for unsigned numbers.
  2. Booth’s algorithm for two’s complement numbers.
- Analyze processing delay and power consumption.

### Lab 4:
**Problem:**
- Design a RISC-V Instruction Decoder unit and Register File Unit.
- **Decoder Unit:**
  - Takes a 32-bit RISC-V ISA instruction (R-type and I-type only).
  - Outputs opcode, addresses of source registers, destination register, and immediate value.
- **Register File:**
  - 32 32-bit registers (x0 to x31).
  - Two read ports, one write port.
  - Reads or updates registers based on input.
  
### Lab 6:
**Problem:**
- Design a two-stage RISC-V Pipeline combining ALU and Register File.
- Input: Sequence of 32-bit R-type and I-type instructions.
- Perform operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) using ALU.
- Requires pipeline registers for intermediate data and control values.
- Identify sizes for each stage of pipeline registers.

These labs collectively showcase skills in digital logic design, Verilog programming, processor architecture, and pipeline design. Incorporating these projects into your resume can demonstrate proficiency in hardware design, microarchitecture, and low-level programming.
